Widgetizer tool
==========


The PHP-built widgetizer will build widgets from feeds and output them appropriately on the corresponding templates. It will output in Javascript so can be used on a page where you cannot create server-side code. Other features:
--the templates can be programmed by designers and producers using HTML and CSS and template tags.
--it will cache the application data and rendering, at times that you can set.  This is usually a big improvement over having this all be done in the browser.
--it can have other custom options that you can use in your templates. These options can be set in an XML file.
--You can set different feeds in the widget
